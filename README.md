## My-Weather

This application is built using React and custom SCSS.

The live version of this application can be viewed at:

If the user enters a valid username and password, they are brought to the next form where they are prompted to ask for coordinates.

Once the coordinates are submitted, Axios uses the weather.gov api to provide the city and state based on the provided coordinates.

### Future Development

In the future, I aim to also incorporate weather data for the entered location.
