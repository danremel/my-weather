### My-Weather

This application is built using React and custom SCSS.

If the user enters a valid username and password, they are brought to the next form where they are prompted to ask for coordinates.

Once the coordinates are submitted, Axios uses the weather.gov api to provide the city and state based on the provided coordinates.
